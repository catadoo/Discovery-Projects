This project displays a series of touch-sensitive png icons, arranged on a background bitmap image, using the LodePNG library and the tft screen touch sensor.

Remember to place png image files (48 by 48 pixels @ 24 bit color depth) under "./img" folder in the micro-sdhc card before board reset. Here are sample images under "micro-sdhc" folder for this project.
