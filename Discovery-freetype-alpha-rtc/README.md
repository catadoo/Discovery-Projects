This project displays the time (hh::mm::ss) using the freetype software module along with the onboard built-in RTC module.

Remember to place "SegoeWP.ttf" file under "./font" folder and "image2.bmp" bitmap image file (480 by 272 pixels @ 24 bit color depth) under "./img" folder, in the micro-sdhc card before board reset.
